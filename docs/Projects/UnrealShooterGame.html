            <p>Unreal Shooter game is my first venture into Unreal Engine. Utilizing Unreal 5.5, I learned how to set up
                an unreal project, program in blueprints, and generally how the engine works.

            <p>I had a lot of fun implementing the functionality of the various parts, learning how blueprints work, my
                previous experience from node based programming in Neos and Resonite helped me quite a lot here.
                I did have some trouble figuring out the names of various nodes, since they are not what I am used to ,a
                nd also don't follow the C# naming that I know. For example, the conditional (?:) operator in C# is
                called "Select" in Unreal blueprints.

            <p>
                Though it took a bit to learn the general layout and how the editor works, I do like it, and will
                probably use it more in the future, if projects call for it.
