            <p>This game was made and designed as part of the Customer Project in CMGT at Saxion University.
            <br>Play as a nurse who has to herd sick and healthy NPCs to their houses and hospitals.
            <br>You should be careful because the infection spreads between the NPCs and even to you.
            <br>Eradicate the virus and save the town.</p>
