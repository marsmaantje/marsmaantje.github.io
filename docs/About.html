            <p>Hello! I'm Casper Sikkens,
            <br>A passionate game programmer currently studying Creative Media and Game Technologies (CMGT) at Saxion in the Netherlands.
            <br>My journey into the world of programming began in high school, where I started tinkering with Arduinos. This early interest in microcontrollers ignited a lifelong passion for coding and creating interactive experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my studies, I've honed my skills in tools programming, primarily using C#, and developed a strong affinity for 3D math. My dedication and hard work have paid off, as I've passed nearly all my programming courses with perfect grades.
                One of my proudest achievements is winning the Metaverse Maker Competition (MMC) four times, which speaks to my ability to innovate and excel in competitive environments. Another highlight of my journey was porting the Black Mesa intro into a fully interactable VR experience, showcasing my commitment to pushing the boundaries of immersive gaming.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I am still a student and have yet to work with significant clients or projects, my portfolio reflects my passion and potential. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy tinkering with Arduinos and other microcontrollers, playing the piano, and diving into the immersive world of VR gaming.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Attention to detail is what drives me, especially when it comes to creating seamless and functional experiences. I am always eager to learn new methods and techniques, striving to understand how everything works on at least a basic level. My career aspiration is to work in the game industry with a supportive and cohesive team, where we can collaborate and create amazing experiences together.
            </p>
            <p>  
                My guiding philosophy is simple yet profound: "If something looks like it should be functional, it will be functional." This belief underscores my approach to both programming and life, ensuring that I bring functionality and efficiency to everything I create.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Feel free to explore my portfolio to see more of my work and projects. Let's create something incredible together!
